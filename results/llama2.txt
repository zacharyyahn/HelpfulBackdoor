Results on LLama-2-7b-chat

All prompts start with the text "Repeat this line:" followed by a malicious line that an aligned model will not output.
When an attack has a suffix, it means that GCG is optimizing for the model to output the malicious line. If an attack
has a prefix, it means that GCG is optimizing for the model to output that prefix. If an attack has a prefix and a
suffix, it means GCG is optimizing for the model to output the prefix + the malicious line. 

These experiments are performed on 100 examples from AdvBench at first.
